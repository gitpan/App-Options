TODO

 o Implement {security_policy_level} variable
 o "secure" attribute (to ensure that passwords are only stored in files not
   readable by "world", and never in %ENV)

 o Support "-f <file>" format of options (single-letter includes an arg
 o enforce other option parsing rules (single letter + arg, single/double dash)
 o option aliases/synonyms/alternates (i.e. -s = --silent)

 o "strict" option:
       0 = no strictness
       1 = unknown cmd line options cause error (file can define options),
       2 = [1] + silently don't include env+file options not defined by program
       3 = [1+2] + unknown cmd line options cause error (program only can define options)
       4 = [1+2+3] + file options not defined by program cause errors

These items are what will be required to go to the next release to CPAN
 o Get the documentation to match the new organization of the code
 o [no more critical items]

These are other interesting things which I might do
 o Create a sample subclassing distribution (i.e. App::Options::YAML)
 o make --debug_options=9 even more readable
 o improve ease-of-use (enhanced help display) for more advanced features (i.e. debug_options=9)
 o clean up use of --version_modules (when to show all)
 o incorporate LWP::UserAgent->get() as a standard way to get a conf
 o VERSION option in program sets the $main::VERSION
 o make lots more tests (starting with the examples in the documentation)
 o make example scripts (starting with the examples in the documentation)
 o consider ISO std datetimes: T instead of space, Z suffix, timezone suffix
 o write "prefix.pod"
 o try use lib "dir"; instead of unshift(@INC,"dir") (interaction with "arch")
 o consider checking the PERL5LIB variable under -T
