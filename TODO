These items are what will be required to go to version 1.00.
 o use File::Spec to make file/directory manipulation platform-independent

These are other interesting things which I might do
 o file/cmd variables, var = <FILE>filename (or "cmd|")
 o here documents, var = <<EOF
 o line continuation chars, i.e. var = hello \\nworld
 o setenv arg to set environment variables
 o make lots more tests (starting with the examples in the documentation)
 o make example scripts (starting with the examples in the documentation)
 o add --version support (print out own version and versions of all modules)
 o enforce other option parsing rules (single letter + arg, single/double dash)
 o option aliases/synonyms/alternates (i.e. -s = --silent)
 o "secure" attribute (to ensure that passwords are only stored in files not
   readable by "world", and never in %ENV)
 o "strict" option:
       0 = no strictness
       1 = unknown options cause error (file can define options),
       2 = [1] + unknown cmdline options cause error (program only can define options)
       3 = [1+2] + silently don't include options from file not defined by program
       4 = [1+2+3] + options from file not defined by program cause errors
 o write "prefix.pod"
 o try use lib "dir"; instead of unshift(@INC,"dir") (interaction with "arch")
 o consider checking the PERL5LIB variable under -T
 o allow for subclassing (App::Options::YAML, etc.) (split up the init() method)
