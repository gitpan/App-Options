# CHANGE LOG
#############################################################################

VERSION 0.92
 x cleaned up some warnings which appeared under -w (concatenation of undef)
 x add system-supplied hostname and host options
 x variable substitution works with environment vars (url = http://$ENV{HOST})
 x auto-import of environment vars named "APP_*" even if not otherwise defined
 x usage: undefined values appear as "[undef]" rather than "[]"
 x usage: options appear as "--var=<value>" rather than "--var=<var>"
 x usage: "args_description" describes what's left on cmd line after options removed
 x usage: "value_description" describes option value (instead of "<value>")
 x added an examples directory
 x added a benchmark directory
 x default is $Config{prefix} instead of /usr/local
 x improve debug_options (env vars, etc.) (implemented 6 levels of debug_options)

VERSION 0.91
 x show_all is off by default whenever "option" or "options" used
 x remove app_path_info

VERSION 0.90
 x new "use App::Options (...);" syntax (rather than ->init(...) syntax)

VERSION 0.64
 x added $VERSION to App::Options (use VERSION_FROM in Makefile.PL)
 x fixed bug where "show_all" wasn't showing all on --help
 x touched up titles on pod documentation
 x implement import() method to use module outside the BEGIN block (i.e. use App::Options (@args))
 x update documentation with new syntax using import() method
 x improve show_all logic: show_all = 1 by default always unless overridden

VERSION 0.63
 x improve documentation (api reference, logic flow, usage tutorial)
 x "integer" type now matches integers with underscores (i.e. 1_000_000)
 x "float" type now matches numbers with underscores (i.e. 1_000.000_001)
 x added /etc/app/app.conf to the end of the option file search path
 x default "prefix" is now "/usr/local" instead of "."
 x {env} attribute of "" means don't search any env variable

VERSION 0.62
 x [prog] matches "prog" only. [/prog/] matches by regular expression.
   In version 0.61, the section [list] would match ($app =~ /list/).
   In version 0.62, the section [list] only matches ($app eq "list"),
   while [/list/] matches ($app =~ /list/).
 x type="/regexp/" matches regexp. unknown types ignored.
   In version 0.61, an option type which was not one of the known
   option types (integer, float, date, datetime, etc.), was considered
   automatically as a regular expression.
   In version 0.62, only types which take the form "/regexp/" are
   actually regular expressions.  All other unknown "types" are ignored.
   This sets the groundwork for better forward-compatibility when new
   types are introduced, they will not break older versions of the code.
   It also just seems clearer.
 x "show_all" option - shows all defined options, not just in [ options ]
   In version 0.61, the --help option would show all variables defined
   in the code, on the command line, or in any of the files (i.e.show_all=1).
   However, if the "options" argument is used in the init() method in the
   code, only those enumerated options would be shown (i.e. show_all=0).
   In version 0.62, the same behavior applies unless the "show_all"
   parameter is given explicitly.
 x quoting, var = " hello world "
   In version 0.61, variable values in the option file had leading and
   trailing spaces removed.  This meant that a value of a single space
   was not possible.
   In version 0.62, the same behavior applies.  However, if the 
   remaining text starts with " and ends with ", those quote marks are
   removed.  i.e. var = " " will result in the value of a single space,
   and message = "Hello world. " will have a trailing space.
 x check list of configurable environment vars ("env") instead of
   "APP_${uc_var}"
   In version 0.61, variable values could be supplied by specifying the
   variable prefixed with "APP_".  (i.e. "path" could be specified
   with "APP_PATH")
   In version 0.62, a list of environment variable names may be given
   and the first with a supplied value is used for the value.
   (i.e. options => { path => { env => "PATH" } } will cause the
   "path" variable to be set from the "PATH" environment variable.)

VERSION 0.61
 x Initial release
